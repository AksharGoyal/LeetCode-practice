# LeetCode-practice

A repository containing (possibly efficient) solutions for LeetCode &amp; Wriggly coding challenges.

At the time of speaking, I plan on solving the problems in Solidity and Rust, especially since I am exploring the world of Web3 and it is important to keep practicing and improving your skills. [Wriggly](https://www.wriggly.io/) for Solidity and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) are some ways to employ your critical thinking and problem-solving techniques to better your coding skills.

If you are interested in solving Wriggly challenges locally, I highly recommend setting up [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/first-steps) as it will help you in compilation and writing tests. Similarly, to set rust locally refer to [rustup docs](https://rustup.rs/) though both Wriggly and LeetCode provide their IDE, thus saving space on your PC.

Would you like to contribute? Here are some ways:
- suggest a more efficient solution
- create a PR and add your solution
- react with a star to the repository

Looking forward to hearing feedback from you!
